- [ ] Complete security code review
- [ ] Pass automated security tests
- [ ] Configure production secrets
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Validate SSL certificate configuration
- [ ] Review firewall and network security
- [ ] Document emergency response procedures
- [ ] Train team on security procedures
- [ ] Schedule regular security audits

### Production Validation
- [ ] Verify all security headers are present
