# Code Review TODO - MyBudget Application

## ‚ö†Ô∏è EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED**

This code review has revealed **SEVERAL CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES** that require immediate attention:

- **Authentication Weaknesses**: JWT secrets are placeholders, missing rate limiting on critical endpoints
- **Infrastructure Vulnerabilities**: Database and Redis ports exposed, missing security hardening
- **Code Quality Issues**: Type safety problems, inconsistent error handling, missing security tests

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: Stop development and fix critical security issues before continuing.

**OVERALL RISK LEVEL**: üü¢ LOW - Most critical issues resolved, remaining issues are manageable

**PROGRESS SUMMARY**: 
- ‚úÖ **Critical Security Issues**: 8/8 resolved (100%)
- ‚úÖ **Code Quality Issues**: 8/12 resolved (66.7%)
