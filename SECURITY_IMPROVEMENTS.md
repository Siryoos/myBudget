# Security Improvements Implementation

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented to improve the application's security posture.

## 1. JWT Secret Validation at Startup

### What was implemented:
- Added `validateJWTSecret()` call in `scripts/start-backend.ts` before server initialization
- Server now fails to start if JWT_SECRET is missing, default, or too short

### Security benefits:
- Prevents application startup with weak or missing JWT secrets
- Early detection of configuration issues
- Eliminates runtime security failures

### Files modified:
- `scripts/start-backend.ts` - Added startup validation
- `lib/auth.ts` - Enhanced validation logic

## 2. Enhanced Password Change Security

### What was implemented:
- Added `token_version` and `password_changed_at` fields to users table
- Password changes now increment token version and set timestamp
- JWT payload includes token version and password change timestamp
- JWT verification checks these values against database
- Client re-authentication triggered after password changes

### Security benefits:
- Immediate invalidation of all existing tokens when password changes
- Prevents token reuse after password compromise
- Forces re-authentication for all active sessions
- Database-level token versioning for enhanced security

### Database changes:
- New fields: `token_version` (INTEGER), `password_changed_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ - timezone-aware)
- Indexes on both fields for performance
- Migration script: `database/migrations/add_token_security.sql`
- Uses TIMESTAMPTZ for reliable JWT time comparisons across timezones

### Files modified:
- `types/auth.d.ts` - Updated JWT payload interface
- `lib/auth.ts` - Enhanced token generation and verification
- `app/api/user/change-password/route.ts` - Updated password change logic
- `lib/auth-middleware.ts` - Updated to handle new token structure

## 3. Case-Insensitive Email Validation

### What was implemented:
- Updated email lookup queries to use `lower(email) = lower($1)` comparison
- Added functional index on `lower(email)` for performance
- Consistent case-insensitive email handling across registration and login

### Security benefits:
- Prevents duplicate accounts with mixed-case email variations
- Eliminates potential account enumeration attacks
- Consistent email normalization across the application

### Database changes:
- Functional index: `idx_users_email_lower` on `lower(email)`
- Migration script: `database/migrations/add_email_case_insensitive_index.sql`

### Files modified:
- `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` - Updated email lookup logic
- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Already using case-insensitive comparison

## Migration Instructions

### 1. Run the database migrations:
```bash
npm run tsx scripts/run-migrations.ts
```

**Note:** The `add_token_security.sql` migration automatically converts existing `TIMESTAMP` columns to `TIMESTAMPTZ` (timezone-aware) to ensure reliable JWT time comparisons across different timezones. Existing data is preserved and converted to UTC.

### 2. Restart the backend server:
```bash
npm run tsx scripts/start-backend.ts
```

## Testing the Security Features

### 1. JWT Secret Validation:
- Try starting the server with invalid JWT_SECRET
- Verify startup fails with appropriate error messages

### 2. Password Change Security:
- Change a user's password
- Verify existing tokens become invalid
- Check that new tokens include version information

### 3. Email Case Insensitivity:
- Try registering users with mixed-case email variations
- Verify duplicate detection works correctly

## Security Considerations

### Token Versioning:
- Each password change increments token version
- All existing tokens become invalid immediately
- New tokens include current version information

### Password Change Tracking:
- Timestamp recorded for each password change
- JWT verification checks against this timestamp
- Prevents token reuse after password changes

### Email Normalization:
- All emails stored in lowercase
- Consistent comparison across all endpoints
- Prevents case-sensitivity related security issues

## Future Enhancements

### Potential improvements:
- Add refresh token rotation
- Implement rate limiting on password changes
- Add audit logging for security events
- Consider adding MFA support

## Compliance Notes

These improvements help address:
- OWASP Top 10 security risks
- Session management best practices
- Password security requirements
- Account enumeration prevention
