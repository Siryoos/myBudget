- **Changes**: Implemented consistent error response format
- **Impact**: Better error tracking, consistent API responses

### ✅ **6. Enhanced Testing Configuration**
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **File**: `jest.config.js`, `jest.setup.js`, `jest.env.js`
- **Changes**: Comprehensive Jest setup with security mocks
- **Impact**: Better test coverage, secure testing environment

### ✅ **7. Next.js Security Configuration**
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **File**: `next.config.js`
- **Changes**: Added security headers, performance optimizations
- **Impact**: Better security, improved performance

## 🧪 Code Quality & Testing Issues

### ✅ **8. Security Validation Script**
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **File**: `scripts/security-check.js`
- **Changes**: Automated security checking script
- **Impact**: Continuous security monitoring, automated validation

### ✅ **9. Package Dependencies**
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **File**: `package.json`
- **Changes**: Added Redis, testing dependencies, security scripts
- **Impact**: Better functionality, improved testing, security tools
